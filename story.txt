Much like every other Wednesday night, I finished my Apfelkuchen, strapped on my lederhosen, and I was ready to go.
Even though I had not washed my BMW since going off roading I still decided I needed to go see the Rammstein.
Who cares if the car is dirty, I just need klimaanlage and I'm good to go.
